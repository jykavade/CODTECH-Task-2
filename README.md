**ID:**-CTO8DS4914
**Duration:**-July to August
**Mentor:**-MUZAMMIL AHMED

**Overview Of The Project**-
**Project : Student Grade Tracker**

Functional Requirements:

User Input: The program should allow users to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
Grade Calculation: The program should calculate the average grade for each subject or assignment.
Overall Grade Calculation: The program should calculate the overall average grade for all subjects or assignments.
Letter Grade Conversion: The program should convert the average grade to a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
GPA Calculation: The program should calculate the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the letter grade.
Display Grades: The program should display the grades, average grades, letter grades, and GPA for each subject or assignment, as well as the overall average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
Non-Functional Requirements:

User-Friendly Interface: The program should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and understand.
Error Handling: The program should handle errors and exceptions, such as invalid input or division by zero.
Data Storage: The program should store the grades and calculations in a way that allows for easy retrieval and display.
Technical Requirements:

Programming Language: Python 3.x
Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, and objects to store and manipulate grades and calculations.
Input/Output: Command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) for user input and output.
Project Components:

Student Class: A Python class to represent a student, with attributes for name, grades, and calculations.
Grade Calculator: A function or method to calculate the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
User Interface: A CLI or GUI to interact with the user and display the grades and calculations.
Data Storage: A mechanism to store the grades and calculations, such as a dictionary or a file.
Project Timeline:

Day 1-2: Design and implement the Student class and Grade Calculator.
Day 3-4: Develop the User Interface (CLI or GUI).
Day 5-6: Implement Data Storage and error handling.
Day 7: Test and debug the program.
Project Deliverables:

Source Code: The Python program with comments and documentation.
User Manual: A document explaining how to use the program.
Test Cases: A set of test cases to verify the program's functionality.
This project overview provides a comprehensive outline of the Student Grade Tracker project, including its functional and non-functional requirements, technical requirements, project components, timeline, and deliverables.
